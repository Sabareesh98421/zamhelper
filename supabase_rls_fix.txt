The application build is failing with the error: 'infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"'. This is caused by a recursive Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the 'profiles' table in Supabase.

To fix this, the RLS policies for the 'profiles' table need to be reviewed and rewritten to avoid recursion. I have asked the user to provide the current policies from their Supabase dashboard.
